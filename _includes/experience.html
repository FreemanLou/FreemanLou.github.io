            <p>This summer I interned at Akamai Technologies in their Fort Lauderdale branch.
                I worked in the front end engineering team, developing new features and fixing
                bugs for customer-facing dashboard products. I mainly used AngularJS, and learned
                more about ES6 and Node.js during the internship.
